#  Creating an online company

I'm having this idea to create my own company.

All alone, by myself.

I want to ingest data about market movements and product adoption.
E.g. searches for buy （買う）and sell （売る）. And also terms that suggest adoption.
Explain how the diffusion of innovation works, and its roadmap.
Also, what we can expect.

Most important I want live data ingestion. And use this data to make offline graphs and predictions.

I want to send automatized email newsletters.

The modus operandi will be Patreon to write blogs.
And premium content will be sent to mail.

The amount of work is negligible once it is up and running.

Of course, when more people join the team the amount of output and services can be expanded.

So, send me a message.

Contact me.
